# Data Wrangling

Go over tidyverse functions here


## Principle components analysis
Even if there's error associated with each particular test, they all aim to measure something undernearth and that thing is hypothesized to be the same

EX) ravens, letters, numbers - are they measuring the same thing? that is, are they measuring the same factor?

We could use the slope of the line to see how related they are
Project each point (not residual way) onto the line and use that point as their "intelligence score"
THe principal component analysis shows that the "factor" is fluid intelligence


### Factor Analysis
Modeling the variance that is common to the two types - get rid of sleepiness factor that everyone has
Kind of like dimension reduction
