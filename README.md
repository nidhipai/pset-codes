PSET learns R, stats, and coding!

Onboarding guide: these are things to install and set up

## Git
Git is a method of version control, meaning that it allows multiple contributers to add to work on the same project. We will be using GitHub kind of like Google Drive to document our progress. We each have a folder that contains our notes. Using git, we can see each other's notebooks. If and when we work on projects together (or you work on code with anyone else in your future), git is critical to ensuring a smooth workflow.
You can download the appropriate version of git here:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Next, make an account on GitHub, and ask Nidhi to be added as a collaborator to this repository.

## R
R is a statistical programming language. It is free and open source, and many psychologists (and other scientists) use R to conduct their statistical analsyses.
You can download the right version of R here:
https://cran.r-project.org/

## Anaconda
Anaconda is a Python installation that includes Jupyter notebook and R Studio. You can install Anaconda here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Python is a versatile and popular programming language that is used for practically everything. The package PsychoPy (https://www.psychopy.org/) allows you to create experiments, like the Stroop task.

Jupter notebook is where we will be documenting what we learn. A notebook is a file that consists of cells. The cells can be Markdown (like this document) or code (R in our case). Using these notebooks, we can write notes about what we learn and also include the code itself. These documents are really polished and are made to be shared and presented. Here's an example: https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/binder-examples-r-jpbnriyj/notebooks/index.ipynb

R Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a workspace and many tools for running R scripts. R Studio also has an R Markdown notebook option that's kind of like Jupyter notebook.

## R Environment in Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter usually uses the Python kernel (the code is Python), so we have to create an R environment in Anaconda to use Jupyter with. Here are the instructions: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/

## Jupyter Book
We don't really need this, but Jupyter Book allows us to bundle our notebooks into a pretty book that is hyperlinked, with navigation tabs, etc (kind of like most of the documentation links on this page). An example and instructions to get started can be found here: https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html
